It said the surge it saw, driven by both the Call of Duty patch and the live streaming of four European football games, hit a peak network traffic of 20.86 Tbps (terabits per second). It had seen Christmas peaks of above 21 Tbps.Virgin, however, said its traffic record reflected a constant increase since the first pandemic lockdown.The first lockdown saw a sudden burst of activity on home broadband networks, prompting fears that the national network would be unable to cope - fears which proved to be unfounded, as systems stayed largely stable.UK broadband speeds up despite lockdown wobbleUK internet use doubles in 2020 due to pandemicDuring January and February's cold snap, usage was up 7.4GB a day compared with the same months last year, pre-lockdown.But Virgin says downloads are up in the current lockdown compared with the first in 2020, with the average user downloading an extra 3.1GB a day.Habits have changed too, with weekday afternoons between 14:00 and 16:00 becoming the busiest period for \"upstream traffic\" - that is, sending data to the internet, whether through emails, uploads or video calls - for the first timeThe information was based on an analysis of some five million broadband customers' accounts, the company said.Gaming growthOne caveat is that the amount of data being pushed through the nation's broadband networks is constantly growing as demand increases.Mark Jackson, editor of industry site ISPreview, wrote that \"demand for data is constantly risingand so new peaks of usage are being set all the time\".Usage typically went up by 30% or more each year, he added.However, Covid-19 lockdowns have accelerated that trend as demand has shifted away from offices to home broadband users. Video calls, remote learning and other high-data usage have also risen.Gaming also makes a big contribution, due to the fact that many gamers download all their titles rather than buying discs these days - and even those who do prefer physical copies need to download large updates on a constant basis.";
